 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game. It is
 * connected to other rooms via exits. The exits are labelled north,
 * east, south, west. For each direction, the room stores a reference
 * to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
